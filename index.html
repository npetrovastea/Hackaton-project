        <p>(Page 1) In the land of Steamhollow, where gears whir and engines roar, a young tinkerer named Eli lived. He
          had just completed his apprenticeship with the town's top mechanic, Master Cogsworth. One fateful day, a royal
          decree was issued: Princess Amelia, beloved of all Steamhollow, was taken captive by a monstrous mechanical
          dragon and locked away in the high tower of Ironspire.</p>
